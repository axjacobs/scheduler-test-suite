ARG policy FIFO
ARG jobs 3
ARG maxlen 10
ARG seed 0

Here is the job list, with the run time of each job: 
  Job 0 ( length = 9 )
  Job 1 ( length = 8 )
  Job 2 ( length = 5 )


Compute the turnaround time, response time, and wait time for each job.
When you are done, run this program again, with the same arguments,
but with -c, which will thus provide you with the answers. You can use
-s <somenumber> or your own job list (-l 10,15,20 for example)
to generate different problems for yourself.
